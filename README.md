# PiCAST 3 (NOT ONLINE YET, GO TO PICAST2 BRANCH)
PiCAST turns your $35 Raspberry Pi in to a Chromecast and beyond like Device.

<b>Why Make PiCAST?</b>

Several years back I wanted to buy a Google Chromecast originally but it was sold out. So, I thought what do I have that I could use w/HDMI and wouldn't be terribly hard to do? My Raspberry Pi can do it all & now the PiZERO can too!

As Chromecast has changed over the past few years, my interest in this project went away... BUT... I had some time off and wanted to see how tiny we could make PiCAST (not including just the requirements- which to be debated). So, PiCAST 3 is here.

<b>THIS ISN'T CHROMECAST! YOU LIE!!!</b>

As many seem unable to read or understand where the project CURRENTLY is and where it WILL go, I felt I need to dumb it down even more. This project doesn't have over 20-100+ paid-staffers, millions of dollars backed to ensure it succeeds, a dedicated team, and MONTHS & MONTHS of work where the PiCAST HAS NONE OF THE ABOVE-- so, calm down!

I made it very clear, this is "LIKE" a chromecast, as it can be sent commands REMOTELY just like the Chromecast (now via Browser/HTTP Request via CURL or even WGET)... I am working on the BEST possible method(s) to continue forward.

So before you go nuts that the project isn't what YOU think, think twice. I do have a full-time job BUT I am so upset with Google, I want an OPEN, FREE, US/NON-US PERMITTED USERBASE, and if you're against it? Don't download it, go make your own and share it or don't. 

<b>WHAT TO EXPECT TO BE INSTALLED...</b>

<b>I WANT MY TIME/FREE EXCHANGE! WHO DO I COMPLAIN TO?</b>

Easy does it... Tweet me, @LanceSeidman as that's the best chance of a response.
